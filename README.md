VoicePing Android SDK is an Android library, provided by
[Smart Walkie Talkie](http://www.smartwalkie.com), for enabling Push-To-Talk (PTT) functionality to
your Android project. It allows you to quickly add group voice broadcast capability to your app. VoicePing Android SDK comes with a reference Android App (with UI) that demonstrates the one button Push-To-Talk interface.

## Get Started

You can test our sample app here: [Download VP Demo app](https://github.com/SmartWalkieOrg/VoicePingAndroidSDK/releases). The sample app allows you to test the Walkie Talkie function. You will need at least _two_ android devices to test properly.  
You can input **_any_** user ID and company name. To communicate, devices should have same company name but different user ID.

## Documentation

If you need more detailed info, you can have a look at [VoicePing walkie talkie Push-to-Talk (PTT) sdk documentation page](https://opensource.voiceping.info).
